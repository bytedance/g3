Long-Term Support
-----

# Policy

We will offer LTS branches for components that is considered to be production ready.

LTS branches will only get bug & security fixes, so there won't be any new features or breaking changes.
The dependency lock file `Cargo.lock` will only get semver compatible updates when necessary.

Each LTS branch will be supported until 6 months after the next LTS branch for the same component.
You can ask for commercial support if you need a longer support time.

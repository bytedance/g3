Route Query
===========

We need a peer service in :ref:`route_query escaper <configuration_escaper_route_query>`. This page describes the
protocol we used to communicate with the peer service.

The peer service should listen on a UDP port, which may be IPv4 or IPv6 based, we will sending requests to this port.

Each UDP packet from our side to the peer service will contains exactly one request. And each UDP packet from the peer
service should contains exactly one response.

Both the request and the response are structured data and should be encoded in `msgpack`_ format.

.. _msgpack: https://msgpack.org/

The root of the request and the response should be a map, we will describe the keys of them in the following.

request

For *seq* value, each of its element must be :ref:`weighted metric node name <conf_value_weighted_metric_node_name>`.

If empty, the :ref:`fallback node <configuration_escaper_route_query_fallback_node>` escaper config will take effect.

**default**: empty

ttl
---

**optional**, **type**: u32

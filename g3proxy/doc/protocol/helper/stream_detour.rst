=============
Stream Detour
=============

An external interception server can implement this to intercept protocols that are configured
with `detour` inspect policy in :ref:`auditor <configuration_auditor>` config, each protocol will have
a separate config option.

The external server should listen to a QUIC port, and configure it by setting
:ref:`stream detour service <conf_auditor_stream_detour_service>` in auditor config.

g3proxy will connect to this port to setup a lot if IDLE connections at the beginning,
And will open two bidirectional QUIC streams for a single client-remote stream when needed,
one is called north stream, another one called south stream.

North Stream
------------

The north stream will be used to forward data sending by client to remote.

Initially g3proxy will send a ProxyProtocolV2 header to the server,

The PPv2 Type-Values are:

* 0xE0 | Upstream Address

  The target upstream address, encoded in UTF-8 without trailing '\0'.
  This will always be set.

* 0xE2 | Username

  The username of the client, encoded in UTF-8 without trailing '\0'.
  This will be set only if client auth is enabled.

* 0xE3 | Task ID

  The task id in UUID binary format. This will always be set.

* 0xE4 | Protocol

  The detected protocol string, encoded in UTF-8 without trailing '\0'.
  This will always be set.

  You will find the detail value in :ref:`auditor <configuration_auditor>` config.

* 0xE5 | Match ID

  The ID used to combine the north stream and the south stream.
  The value will be a 2-bytes uint16 value, in big-endian.

* 0xE6 | Payload

  Extra payload data. The value will be vary depending on the *protocol*.
  This will only be set when needed by that *protocol*.

  You will find the detail value description in :ref:`auditor <configuration_auditor>` config.

After sending the PPv2 header, g3proxy will waiting a 4-bytes response from the server.

- The first 2 bytes should be a uint16 value in big-endian.
- The last 2 bytes should be a uint16 action code in big-endian. The supported actions:

  * 0 - continue

    Continue to send data, the data flow will be `client_read -> detour_server -> remote_write`.

  * 1 - bypass

    Skip the detour server, transfer client - remote data directly.

  * 2 - block

    Block the client-remote transfer, close the connection immediately.

South Stream
------------

The south stream will be used to forward data sending by remote to client.

Initially g3proxy will send a ProxyProtocolV2 header to the server,

The PPv2 Type-Values are:

* 0xE5 | Match ID

  The ID used to combine the north stream and the south stream.
  The value will be a 2-bytes uint16 value, in big-endian.

After sending that PPv2 header, the data flow will be `remote_read -> detour_server -> client_write`.

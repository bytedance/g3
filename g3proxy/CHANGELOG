 - Optimization: do not count in target port in rendezvous selection for proxy escapers.
 - Optimization: adjust custom headers and settings for http_proxy server:
     - add header X-BD-Remote-Connection-Info, which will be set if server_id in config is set.
     - remove header X-BD-Remote-Connection-Expire, as it contains in X-BD-Remote-Connection-Info.
     - remove option http_forward_upstream_id, add option http_forward_mark_upstream instead,
       which requires server_id to be set. The value for header X-BD-Upstream-Id will be server_id.
 - Optimization: change some fields in tcp connect logs:
     - add "next-bind-ip" to record the bind ip we selected before the connection.
     - rename "tcp-expire" to "next-expire", this is the peer expire time, not only the connection.
     - rename "next-bind" to "next-bound-addr", this is the local addr from which we connect to remote.
     - rename "next-peer" to "next-peer-addr", which is the remote socket address.
 - Optimization: use parking_lot::Mutex for short non-async operations.
 - BUG FIX: fix peer update for proxy_float escaper.
 - BUG FIX: use only ICANN domains in psl data file.

v0.4.4:
  - Feature: support non-blocking redis-cluster dynamic peer update
  - Feature: introduce selective vector and use it in proxy escapers
      The nodes can be weighted, and we support random/sequence/rendezvous pick policies
  - Feature: support redis 6 AUTH with username
  - Feature: add user stats, including connection/request/traffic stats
  - Optimization: use ahash instead of std hash for better performance

v0.4.3:
  - BUG FIX: resolver: fix empty records with Ipv4First policy if ipv6 resolver return empty first

v0.4.2:
  - Feature: allow to set request limit at user level

v0.4.1:
  - Feature: add user group reload action in daemon helper script
  - Feature: allow to set rate limit at user level at the server side
  - Feature: respect expire value in proxy_float escaper, the following options are added:
      - expire_guard_seconds
          This will set some buffer time between the time we make the selection and
          the time we make the real connection
  - Feature: allow http dynamic peer to append extra headers via "extra_append_headers"
  - BUG FIX: fix handling of multiple http headers

v0.4.0:
  - Feature: add proxy_float escaper
  - Feature: add proxy_socks5 escaper
  - Feature: add some custom response headers for http_proxy server
      - X-BD-Upstream-Id
          For http forward protocol. It means that the response comes from remote side
          if this header is present, at least the remote side of the proxy which has
          been set with the same 'upstream id' value.
      - X-BD-Remote-Connection-Expire
          May be present in all http responses. If the value is a valid rfc3339 datetime
          string, the remote connection will expire after this time, and the pending data
          may be failed to transfer. New requests should not be affected if the connection
          to the proxy is keep-alive and clean. If there are multiple chained proxies on the
          path, the nearest value from now will be kept.
      - X-BD-Upstream-Addr
          If enabled, it contains the upstream addr we attempted to connect to. If there are
          multiple chained proxies on the path, the result from the nearest one to upstream
          will be used. Note not all proxies support such info. It depends on the real
          topology to decide whether it's value is meaningful.
      - X-BD-Outgoing-IP
          If enabled, it will contain the far most ip address we used to connect to upstream.
          If there are multiple chained proxies on the path, the result from the nearest one
          to upstream will be used. Note not all proxies support such info and the ip address
          may still behind NAT. It depends on the real topology to decide whether it's value
          is meaningful.
  - Feature: allow to enable tls for http_proxy server
  - BUG FIX: fix encoding of username and password when used in HTTP contexts,
      now we can support all UTF-8 chars in username and password.
  - BUG FIX: fix the meaning of various stats
      - server stats: count in all data in proxy protocol layer to client, including negotiation
      - escaper stats: count in all data in proxy protocol layer to upstream, including negotiation
      - task stats: only count in real user data both to client and to upstream, excluding negotiation
      - tls is considered as a layer between transport and application, which won't be count in

v0.3.5:
  - BUG FIX: fix install of systemd unit file in deb package

v0.3.4:
  - BUG FIX: fix building of deb package

v0.3.3
  - Feature: allow to set multiple proxy addresses in proxy_http escaper
  - Feature: use the official way to build deb packages

v0.3.2
  - Feature: add json-rpc protocol to local controller
  - Feature: add g3proxy-daemon-helper script for reload and offline actions
  - Feature: add more tcp and http related config options
  - BUG FIX: fix dead lock when reloading route type escapers

v0.3.1
  - Feature: add basic auth to proxy_http escaper
  - Feature: add local_match and radix_match rules to route_upstream escaper
  - BUG FIX: make router in proxy_http escaper really optional

v0.3.0
  - Feature: add sphinx doc for all configurations
  - Feature: add error response body for http_proxy server
  - Feature: add some 'route' type escapers
    The 'route' escapers are used to select next escapers,
    so now escapers can depend on others, but cycle is not allowed in the final dependency graph.
    The following 'route' escapers are added:
      - route_random
      - route_upstream
      - route_dst_ip
  - Feature: add script to generate release tarball
  - Tweak: rename not_existed escaper to dummy_deny
  - Tweak: log optimization

v0.2.2
  - Feature: make systemd service restart graceful, though not perfect
  - Feature: add proxy_http escaper

v0.2.1
  - Optimization: use buffer writer when sending response to client
  - BUG FIX: close connection if remote response is read to end

v0.2.0
  - Initial release with a CHANGELOG.

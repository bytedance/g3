# G3 Project

[中文版 README](README.zh_CN.md)

## About

This is the project we used to build enterprise-oriented generic proxy solutions,
including but not limited to proxy / reverse proxy (WIP) / load balancer (TBD) / nat traversal (TBD).

## Components

G3 Project is make up of many components.

The project level docs resides in the *doc* subdirectory, and you should see the links below for the important ones.
Each component will have its own doc in its *doc* subdirectory.

### g3proxy

A generic forward proxy solution, but you can also use it as tcp streaming / transparent proxy / reverse proxy
as we have basic support built in.

See [g3proxy](g3proxy/README.md) for detailed introduction.

### g3tiles

A work in progress reverse proxy solution.

### g3bench

A benchmark tool, which support HTTP 1.x / HTTP 2 / TLS Handshake / Cloudflare Keyless.

See [g3bench](g3bench/README.md) for detailed introduction.

### g3mkcert

A tool to make root CA / intermediate CA / TLS server / TLS client certificates.

### g3fcgen

Fake certificate generator for g3proxy.

## Target Platform

Only Linux is fully supported yet. The code will compile on FreeBSD / NetBSD / MacOS, but we haven't tested it there.

Feel free to open PRs to add support to other platforms.

## Dev-env Setup Guide

Follow [dev-setup](doc/dev-setup.md).

## Standards

Follow [standards](doc/standards.md).

## Release and Packaging

We will set tags for each release of each component, in the form *\<name\>-v\<version\>*.
You can use these tags to generate source tarballs.
And we have added deb and rpm package files for each component that is ready for distribution.

If you want to do a release build:

 1. generate a release tarball

    ```shell
    ./scripts/release/build_tarball.sh <name>-v<version>
    ```

    All vendor sources will be added to the source tarball, so you can save the source tarball and build it offline at
    anywhere that have the compiler and dependencies installed.

 2. build the package

    For deb package:
    ```shell
    tar xf <name>-<version>.tar.xz
    cd <name>-<version>
    ./build_deb_from_tar.sh
    ```

    For rpm package:
    ```shell
    tar xvf <name>-<version>.tar.xz ./<name>-<version>/<name>.spec
    cp <name>-<version>.tar.xz ~/rpmbuild/SOURCES/
    rpmbuild -ba ./<name>-<version>/<name>.spec
    ```

If you want to build a package directly from the git repo:

 - For deb package:

   ```shell
   ./build_deb_from_git.sh <name>
   ```

 - For rpm package:

   ```shell
   ./build_rpm_from_git.sh <name>
   ```
